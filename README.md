# 🧾 AI Agent for Creating Work Completion Acts

Welcome to the **accounting-documents-ai-agent** repository! This project serves as a Proof of Concept for an AI agent designed to generate work completion acts. Built using Python and leveraging LangChain, this agent utilizes GigaChat as its Large Language Model (LLM). 

For a visual guide on AI agents and how to create your own, check out this video: [AI Agents Overview](https://youtu.be/KFgwXXWT7sQ).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the AI agent, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvszph/accounting-documents-ai-agent.git
cd accounting-documents-ai-agent
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to store your API token for GigaChat. This token is necessary for the agent to connect to the GigaChat API.

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your token:

```
GIGACHAT_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use the `uv` package manager to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

### 4. Run the Agent

Now you can run the agent using the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

## 📚 Documentation

### Overview

This AI agent automates the process of creating work completion acts, which can save time and reduce errors. It uses advanced natural language processing to understand the context and requirements for generating these documents.

### Features

- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes GigaChat for natural language understanding.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the code to fit your specific needs.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, even for those with minimal programming experience.

### Architecture

The architecture of the agent is built on Python, utilizing the LangChain framework. This setup allows for easy integration of various AI models and tools.

### Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main entry point for running the agent.
- **.env-example**: A template for your environment variables.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies needed for the project.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file is crucial for the operation of the agent. Make sure to include the following:

- `GIGACHAT_API_TOKEN`: Your unique token for GigaChat API access.

### Customization

You can modify the code to adjust how the agent generates work completion acts. Look into the `main.py` file for the core logic.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the agent, consider the following:

- Ensure your Python version is compatible with the dependencies.
- Double-check your API token for correctness.
- Review the console output for error messages.
